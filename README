* About
- Additional functions to CUDD library
  (related files: cuddauxXXXX.(c|h))
- Interface of CUDD and "CUDDAUX" to OCAML (BDDs, ADDs)
  (A stands for Arithmetic: float OCaml values at the leaves)
- V(alue)DD: MTBDD with any OCaml values at the leaves.
- Higher order functions for VDDs

* What's needed :
- An ANSI C compiler (gcc is the only tested compiler)
- GNU MAKE
- The CUDD BDDs library (http://vlsi.colorado.edu/software.html),
  version 2.4.1 or higher
- OBJECTIVE CAML 3.0 or higher (http://caml.inria.fr)
- CAMLIDL 1.05 (http://caml.inria.fr/camlidl)

- GREP, SED, M4 if you want to regenerate files from .idl files

* This code provides an interface to user's functions of the CUDD
library. It generates five ML modules: Man, Bdd, Add, Vdd, Mtbdd.

* To build,
Set Makefile.config from Makefile.config.model model.

TWO IMPORTANT REMARKS:

1. The CUDD Makefile does not provide an 'install' target, neither dynamic
   libraries.

   To help you for installation, I provide a Makefile.cudd file:
   * look at it and set the variables properly
   * do 'make -f Makefile.cudd'

   Makefile.cudd ensures the following points:

   a. mlcuddidl expect to find .h files in
      $(MLCUDDIDL_PREFIX)/include and .a files
      $(MLCUDDIDL_PREFIX)/lib.

   b. It also expects to find cuddInt.h, which is located in the
      cudd subdirectory when the CUDD source distribution.
 
   c. IMPORTANT: it expects that libutil.a (of CUDD) has been renamed in
      libucddutil.a, to avoid name conflicts with standard /iusr/lib/libutil.a
      libraries found on some systems (like MacOS X).

2. The C compilation flags in XCFLAGS (processor, alignement)
   should be the same than those with which CUDD is compiled.

make rebuild: requested only if download from subvsersion directory.
	      regenerate C and OCaml files from .idl files
              (require m4, sed)
make all: build the bytecode and native versions of the interface
make install: installs the two versions of the interface
make cuddrun: builds a OCaml bytecode interpreter containing the
              CUDD library
make cuddtop: builds a OCaml toplevel containing the interface
make test_mtbdd.byte: build bytecode version of test_mtbdd.ml
make test_mtbdd.opt: build native-code version of test_mtbdd.ml
make clean: normal clean
make mostylclean: delete also generated files (from .idl files)
make rebuild: regenerate C and OCaml files from .idl files
