* About:
  This code provides an OCaml interface to the CUDD BDD library.
  It includes higher-order functions for performing user-defined functions on
  BDDs while taking advantage of CUDD internals (caches and hashtables).

* Contains:
- The CUDD BDDs library (http://vlsi.colorado.edu/software.html),
  version 2.4.2
- Additional functions to CUDD library
  (related files: cuddauxXXXX.(c|h))
- Interface of CUDD to OCAML (BDDs, ADDs)
  (A stands for Arithmetic: float OCaml values at the leaves)
- VDD: MTBDD with any OCaml values at the leaves.
  (V stands for Ocaml Values)
- Higher order functions for VDDs

* What's needed :
- FINDLIB (http://projects.camlcity.org/projects/findlib.html)
- An ANSI C compiler (gcc is the only tested compiler)
- GNU MAKE
- OBJECTIVE CAML 3.12.1 or up (recent version, http://caml.inria.fr)
- CAMLIDL 1.05 (http://caml.inria.fr/camlidl)

- GREP, GNU SED, GNU M4

* To build,
Set Makefile.config from Makefile.config.model model.

A VERY IMPORTANT REMARK:

* Set properly the C compilation flags XCFLAGS (processor, alignement)

make all: build the bytecode and native versions of the interface
make install: installs using FINDLIB and its conventions (package name: cudd)
make uninstall: uninstalls
make (example|test_mtbdd).byte: build bytecode version of test_mtbdd.ml
make (example|test_mtbdd).opt: build native-code version of test_mtbdd.ml
make clean: normal clean
make mostylclean: delete also generated files (from .idl files) and CUDD files

make mlcuddidl.dvi:
make mlcuddidl.pdf:
make html:

You can also look at session.ml.

* IN CASE OF PROBLEM (Makefile.config not configured, bad versions
  of tools, etc...), empty files may be generated from .idl and strange
  errors may occur at compilation. In this case, do

  make distclean

  to reinitialize properly things.
